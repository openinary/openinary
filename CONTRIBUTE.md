To keep Openinary sustainable while staying Open Source, we use an "Open Core" model:

### What does this mean?

- **Open Source Core:** The main Openinary engine remains **free and open source** (GNU AGPLv3) for everyone to self-host
- **Managed Cloud Version:** We plan to launch a managed Cloud offering. Revenue from this service funds long-term maintenance and development of the open-source project
- **Your Rights:** You retain ownership of your contributions
- **License Grant:** You grant Openinary a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, and irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute your contributions under any license (including in commercial offerings)

### Why does Openinary have this?

This CLA allows us to:
- Build a professional managed service without legal friction
- Fund development and maintenance
- Keep the core free and open for the community

**Similar projects using this model:** GitLab, Sentry, Discourse, and many other successful open-source projects.

If you have concerns about this agreement, please open a discussion – we're happy to clarify.
